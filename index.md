> “To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace 
> from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our 
> yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out brief 
> candle! Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and 
> frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more. It is a tale 
> told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”
