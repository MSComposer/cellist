 “To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, creeps in this petty pace 
 from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. And all our 
 yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, out brief 
 candle! Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and 
 frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more. It is a tale 
 told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.”
    
    — William Shakespeare, “Macbeth.”
